    <p>The United Nations Agenda is of critical importance to all, especially for small states,
      <strong>LDC</strong>’s and
      <strong>SIDS</strong>’- members of
      <strong>FOSS</strong>. It is essential they have a strong understanding and knowledge of the tools and services that may help them to participate efficiently within the United Nations. This app ranges from basic administrative forms to the vast breadth
      of UN research tools and documentation. We hope that “How-To in the UN” will assist in building more cohesive and effective delegates today while levelling the playing field.</p>
